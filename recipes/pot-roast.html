    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3<sup>1/2</sup>to 4 LB Beef Chuck Roast</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons, Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 Yellow Onion</li>
        <li>2 Leeks, White and Yellow Parts Only</li>
        <li>6 Garlic Cloves</li>
        <li>1 Cup Red Wine</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons Tomato Paste</li>
        <li>6 Cups Beef Stock</li>
        <li>2 Bay Leaves</li>
        <li>8 to 10 Sprigs Fresh Thyme</li>
        <li>8 to 10 Sprigs Fresh Parsley</li>
        <li>2 LB Baby Yukon Potatoes</li>
        <li>6 Carrots Cut Into 2" Pieces</li>
        <li>4 Ribs of Celery Cut Into 2" Pieces</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Generously season the beef on all sides with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add the olive oil to a large Dutch oven pot over high heat until it smokes lightly.</li>
        <li>Place in the beef, turn the heat down to medium, and sear on all sides until it's golden brown all around. This will take 3 to 4 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Set the beef aside on a plate and add the onions and leeks, season with salt, and saute for 4 to 6 minutes. Then, turn the heat to medium-low and continue cooking for 10 minutes or until the onions are well browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, which takes 30 to 45 seconds.</li>
        <li>Degalze with a quarter cup of wine and cook until it's completely absorbed.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until it is incorporated into the vegetables.</li>
        <li>Pour in the rest of the wine, beef stock, bay leaves, thyme, parsley, salt, and pepper and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Add back in the seared beef and bring to a boil. Add on a lid, place it on a rack in the lower third of the oven, and cook at 325 degrees for 3 <sup>1/2</sup>to 4 hours or until fork tender.</li>
        <li>With about 70 minutes left in the cooking process, add the potatoes, carrots, celery, and any other vegetables to the pot along with the beef and finish cooking alongside the pot roast.</li>
    </ol>
